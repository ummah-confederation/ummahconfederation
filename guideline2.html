      <h2>GUIDELINE II : SSC DESIGN GUIDELINE</h2>

      <h3>PREAMBLE</h3>
      <p>
        This document defines how media operations are structured within Ummah
        Media Worldwide. SSC is Segment -> Series -> Content.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h3>TITLE 1 : MEDIA HIERARCHY</h3>

      <h4>Article 1 – Institution (Entity)</h4>
      <p>
        Ummah Media Worldwide is the parent institution regarding media in
        Daarussalaam facing directly to the audience. It provides vision,
        governance, and long-term direction for all media operations.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 2 – Segment (Role)</h4>
      <p>
        A segment represents a <strong>bounded social role</strong> performed in
        public. Each segment has a clear function, scope, and responsibility.
        Because media is human-facing, each segment is understood as a role
        rather than a mechanical process.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 3 – Series (Program)</h4>
      <p>
        A series (also referred to as a program or show) is a
        <strong>branded, recurring content line</strong> operating within a
        segment. Multiple series may exist under the same segment, each with its
        own title, tone, and aesthetic.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 4 – Content (Asset)</h4>
      <p>
        Content refers to individual media outputs (posts, reels, carousels,
        etc.). Each content item belongs to a specific series and is distributed
        through an official account.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h3>TITLE 2 : CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES</h3>

      <h4>Article 1 – Operational Clarity</h4>
      <p>Each segment must clearly define:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Inputs (what information comes in)</li>
        <li>Process (how it is handled)</li>
        <li>Outputs (what is published)</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Article 2 – Legibility to the Audience</h4>
      <p>
        A segment and its series should be immediately understandable without
        explanation. The audience should intuitively recognize the role being
        performed and its boundaries.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 3 – Design by Current Capacity</h4>
      <p>
        Segments and series are created according to current capacity (time,
        budget, skills, and network). Roles that cannot yet be performed
        properly must be deferred. Production ambition must match operational
        reality.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h3>TITLE 3 : FIRST SEGMENT — INDEXER</h3>

      <h4>Article 1 – Segment Definition</h4>
      <p>
        The first segment operated by Ummah Media Worldwide is the
        <strong>Indexer</strong>. The Indexer’s role is to systematically
        collect, organize, and surface information of value to the community.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Indexer functions as a <strong>utility segment</strong>. Its purpose
        is not hype or personality-driven engagement, but long-term usefulness.
        The audience follows the account because it is practically valuable and
        costly to miss.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 2 – Inputs</h4>
      <p>
        Typical inputs include Qur’anic verses, Hadith, scholarly quotations,
        public discussions, and other indexable materials relevant to the
        community.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 3 – Series Within the Indexer Segment</h4>
      <p>
        Multiple series may operate under the Indexer segment. Each series has
        its own name, branding, and tone, while remaining fully aligned with the
        Indexer role.
      </p>

      <p>
        The existence of multiple series does not imply multiple segments. All
        series inherit the boundaries and responsibilities of the Indexer
        segment.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 4 – Process</h4>
      <p>
        Inputs are logged as they appear and transformed into content according
        to the relevant series guidelines, including visual style, tone, and
        framing.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 5 – Outputs</h4>
      <p>
        Outputs consist of published content assets (e.g., Instagram posts,
        reels, or carousels). Each asset is attributed to a specific series and
        distributed through official Ummah Media channels.
      </p>

      <h3>TITLE 4 : FUTURE SEGMENTS</h3>

      <h4>Article 1 – Expansion, Independence & Document Updates</h4>
      <p>
        As institutional capacity increases, and by the permission of God,
        additional segments may be established. Each new segment represents a
        distinct social role and a clearly bounded function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every segment remains operationally independent and focused exclusively
        on its designated role. The creation of any new segment requires the
        addition of a corresponding title within this document to formally
        record and govern its existence.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 2 – Explainer Segment</h4>
      <p>
        An Explainer segment may be introduced when sufficient production
        capacity exists. Its role is to explain concepts clearly, often through
        long-form or video-based media.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 3 – Diaspora Connector Segment</h4>
      <p>
        A Connector segment may be introduced once sufficient network access and
        verification capacity exist. Its role is to surface opportunities,
        initiatives, and connections to the audience.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 4 – Institution-Audience Connector</h4>
      <p>
        Not yet drafted.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 5 – Films</h4>
      <p>
        Not yet drafted.
      </p>
