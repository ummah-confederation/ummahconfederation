      <h2>BOOK I : THE CONSTITUTION</h2>

      <h3>PREAMBLE</h3>
      <p>
        This Constitution establishes the foundational principles upon which all
        legislative, executive and judicative acts within the Abode of Peace
        (Daarussalaam) are built, ordered by the verses of Surah Al-Fatihah.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h3>TITLE 1 : SURAH 1 VERSE 1</h3>

      <h4>Article 1 – Translation</h4>
      <p>
        <em
          >"In the name of Allah, The Most Compassionate, The Most Merciful"</em
        >
      </p>

      <h4>Article 2 – Mandate of Divine Instrumentality</h4>
      <p>
        All legislative, executive, and judicial acts shall be done in the name
        of Allah, the Most Compassionate, The Most Merciful. Those exercising
        such authority are not the source of power, but instruments through
        which God's compassion and mercy flow into the world:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Any legislative, executive, or judicial act devoid of compassion and
          mercy violates the principle of divine instrumentality.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any legislative, executive, or judicial act filled with compassion and
          mercy is an act of God alone. Human authorities claim neither
          authorship nor credit, serving solely as instruments.
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              When you do good for yourself in the name of Allah, God is
              channeling His compassion and mercy to you through your own hands.
              If you believe you are the doer, it feels empty—because you're
              only acting for yourself. But when you realize He has done this
              for you through you, your heart fills with the awareness of divine
              presence and care in every act and taqdeer.
            </li>
            <li>
              When one does good for others in the name of Allah, mercy reaches
              them through you, the servant. Believing “I did this for them”
              breeds entitlement. Realizing “Allah relieved them, and I was
              allowed to witness it” dissolves the self into humility and
              surrender in every act and taqdeer.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>(NB)</strong> To test whether an act fulfills this mandate of
        divine instrumentality, ask yourself: Can I invoke the name of Allah
        while performing this action? Can I publicly declare that this was done
        in His name? Acts lacking compassion and mercy typically demand
        secrecy—they cannot withstand the light of public declaration under His
        name. However, public declaration alone does not prove compliance, as
        wrongdoing can be brazenly proclaimed under divine invocation. Likewise,
        acts committed publicly without invoking His name are not automatically
        non-compliant, as wrongdoing can occur without divine attribution.
        Therefore, every act must be evaluated on its substance under subsection
        (1).

      <h3>TITLE 2 : SURAH 1 VERSE 2-4</h3>

      <h4>Article 1 – Translation</h4>
      <p>
        <em>"All praise is for Allah—Rabb of all worlds."</em><br />
        <em>"The Most Compassionate, Most Merciful."</em><br />
        <em>"Malik of the Day of Judgment."</em>
      </p>
      <h4>Article 2 – Hamd</h4>
      <p>
        The most devastating thought a human being can have in their low is to
        think they don't belong there—that they're meant to be somewhere else.
        This can lead to deep depression, even to killing themselves over it.
        The most detrimental thought a human being can have in their high is to
        think they do belong there—that this is where they're meant to be. This
        can lead to deep hubris, even to killing others over it. Hamd
        neutralizes all positions. The low are alleviated, the high humbled. The
        low are alleviated by realizing their position is not a mistake—it's the
        placement of the Most Merciful. The high are humbled by realizing their
        position becomes a mistake the moment compassion is gone. Through
        praising God (hamd), all stand equally, shoulder to shoulder, serving as
        instruments of the Divine.
      </p>
      <h4>Article 3 – Rabb</h4>
      <p>
        The low are alleviated by understanding who placed them there: the
        Rabb—the One who originates all things and who, through continual
        sustenance and nurture, brings them toward their proper perfection. Your
        position is not an error to escape, but a placement by the One who is
        actively bringing you toward completion.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 4 – Malik</h4>
      <p>
        The high are humbled by understanding who granted them their position:
        the Malik—the One who, by right of origination, holds dominion over all
        things; and by responsibility for sustenance, renders judgment upon
        those who corrupt what was ordained for perfection—not from a
        disposition toward judgment, but because justice, when violated, demands
        restoration at the claim of the exploited party. Your elevation is not
        ownership to defend by any means, but a trust held under the gaze of the
        One who will hold you accountable for how you wielded it.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 5 – Mandate of Excellence</h4>
      <p>
        Because we stand between Rabb and Malik—sustained by one, accountable to
        the other—we are bound to the Mandate of Excellence:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Moral Accountability: All persons shall act as if they see their Rabb;
          and if they do not see Him, then indeed their Rabb sees them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Legal Accountability: All persons shall act as if they see their
          Malik; and if they do not see Him, then indeed their Malik sees them.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>(NB)</strong> The Core Question on Excellence: Can you make
        every movement—small or large, alone or in company—an act of worship /
        gratitude to Rabb & Malik?
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h3>TITLE 3 : SURAH 1 VERSE 5</h3>

      <h4>Article 1 – Translation</h4>
      <p><em>"You ˹alone˺ we worship and You ˹alone˺ we ask for help."</em></p>

      <h4>Article 2 – Mandate of The Great Independence</h4>
      <p>
        Having established who deserves praise (Rabb and Malik) and how to
        conduct ourselves under their gaze (excellence), we now declare where
        ultimate worship and reliance must be directed:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Ibadah to True God (Rabb & Malik): To Him alone we direct our ultimate
          worship and obedience. Not self or other entities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Isti'anah to True God (Rabb & Malik): To Him alone we direct our
          ultimate trust and reliance. Not self or other entities.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>(NB)</strong> Principle of Loyalty Revelation: That which a
        person continues to worship and obey when worship and obedience entail
        genuine cost constitutes their true God. This loyalty may be maintained
        progressively as resources decline, but the ultimate test manifests when
        all resources are exhausted. At that juncture, whatever one resorts to
        and relies upon—if doing so requires the willful abandonment of one’s
        professed object of worship and obedience, or the peaceful acceptance of
        such abandonment—reveals one’s true God.
      </p>

      <h3>TITLE 4 : SURAH 1 VERSE 6</h3>

      <h4>Article 1 – Translation</h4>
      <p>
        <em>"Guide us along the Straight Path"</em>
      </p>

      <h4>Article 2 – Huda</h4>
      <p>
        Huda is (1) the divine direction toward recognizing the truth and (2)
        the divine assistance that enables action upon it. Toward this we turn
        to God seventeen times each day in humility and reliance, pleading for
        it so that God, through huda, may enable us to preserve the mandate of
        the great independence: directing exclusive Ibadah and Istiʿanah to the
        True God.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 3 – Recognized Truth</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>A Posteriori Truth.</li>
        <li>A Priori Truth.</li>
        <li>Islamic Truth.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Article 4 – Mandate of Constant Huda Seeking</h4>
      <p>Principle of Truth as a Basis of Action:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Assumption: An assumption, when used as a basis for action, can
          sometimes be useful, because people or even animal, at different
          levels of experience rely on different degrees of intuition or
          instinct. However, for people with limited experience, acting
          primarily on assumptions often leads to reactionary decisions. These
          decisions may become too costly to win (a Pyrrhic victory), too cheap
          to lose (premature defeat), or result in no decision at all, as
          conflicting assumptions block one another and cause paralysis (buntu).
        </li>
        <li>
          Half Truth: A half truth contains elements of correctness but lacks
          critical context or completeness. When used as a basis for action,
          half truth is dangerous because it creates a false sense of certainty
          while hiding key risks or consequences. Acting on half truth often
          leads to misjudgment, escalation of conflict, or irreversible
          mistakes, and therefore should be avoided as a foundation for
          decision-making.
        </li>
        <li>
          Near Truth: Near truth represents information that is not fully
          verified but is sufficiently accurate and context-aware to support
          timely action. Near truth is acceptable when time constraints,
          uncertainty, or rapidly evolving situations make full verification
          impractical. In such cases, delaying action in pursuit of complete
          truth may lead to greater chaos, loss, or harm than acting on a near
          truth.
        </li>
        <li>
          True Truth: True truth is a state of comprehensive, verified
          understanding, where facts, context, and consequences are clearly
          known. It is the ideal basis for action (avoiding pyrrhic victory and
          premature defeat biidhnillah) and should be pursued whenever time and
          conditions allow. However, the pursuit of true truth must not paralyze
          decision-making when action is urgently required.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>TITLE 5 : SURAH 1 VERSE 7</h3>

      <h4>Article 1 – Translation</h4>
      <p>
        <em
          >"The Path of those You have blessed—not those You are displeased
          with, or those who are astray"</em
        >
      </p>

      <h4>Article 2 – Mandate of Restorative Endeavor</h4>
      <p>
        Principle of Alignment Revelation: Trials reveal which party a person
        truly belongs to—not by creating their character, but by exposing it
        under pressure. When the cost of pursuing truth becomes real and
        resources begin to fail, the endeavors one continues to produce disclose
        true alignment. This revelation may unfold gradually as hardship
        intensifies, but becomes unmistakable when the choice between
        restorative and destructive action can no longer be avoided.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The Blessed Party: Those who know the truth and act upon it, producing
          restorative endeavors (Biidhnillah) to achieve the Great Independence.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Maghdub Party: Those who know the truth but refuse to act upon it,
          thereby producing oppression—knowingly or unknowingly—through
          destructive endeavors.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Dhallin Party: Those who mistake falsehood for truth and act upon
          it, thereby unknowingly sustaining oppression through destructive
          endeavors initiated by the Maghdub Party.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Burdened Party: Those who neither initiate nor sustain destructive
          endeavors, yet are compelled, without consent, to bear their
          oppressive consequences.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Article 3 – Consider this Example</h4>
      <p>
        In peaceful, prosperous times, nearly all who hold authority profess to
        serve justice, the people, and compassion. Politicians, bureaucrats, and
        judges alike proclaim noble intentions. During such stability, it
        becomes difficult to distinguish who genuinely produces restorative
        endeavors from those who merely perform them.
      </p>
      <p>
        When trials arrive—economic collapse, war, scandal, uprising—the
        alignment of each party becomes manifest:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The Blessed Party maintains principle even at personal cost. They
          refuse bribes when broke, protect the vulnerable when protection
          becomes dangerous, and speak truth when lies would preserve their
          position.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Maghdub Party is exposed. They knew the policy would harm the
          poor. They knew corruption was occurring. Yet they chose power and
          wealth over truth, abandoning what they recognized as right.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Dhallin Party is revealed. Well-meaning officials who genuinely
          believed the propaganda, who implemented harmful policies thinking
          they served the good, who sustained oppression without realizing they
          were instruments of destruction.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Burdened Party becomes visible. Ordinary people who initiated
          nothing, sustained nothing, yet bear the full weight of decisions made
          above them without their consent.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This pattern repeats across history: the fall of regimes, the rise of
        tyrannies, economic catastrophes, and revolutions all function as trials
        that strip away pretense and reveal true character. Those in authority
        fear such crises not merely for the instability they bring, but because
        trials expose what prosperity conceals—who truly serves and who merely
        claims to serve.
