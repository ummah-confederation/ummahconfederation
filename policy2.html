      <h2>POLICY II : REST & GHAFLAH MANAGEMENT</h2>

      <h3>PREAMBLE</h3>
      <p>
        This policy establishes principles for proper rest and the avoidance of
        heedlessness (ghaflah) after demanding work. It recognizes that human
        beings require cooldown phases to release cognitive and physical
        tension, while acknowledging that such moments are opportunities for
        shaytan to lead us astray into useless or sinful activity. The policy
        distinguishes between beneficial rest (worship and social bonding) and
        harmful ghaflah (mindless consumption), providing clear guidance for
        government members.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h3>TITLE 1 : PRINCIPLES OF BENEFICIAL REST</h3>

      <h4>Article 1 – The Nature of Rest</h4>
      <p>
        Each significant job, especially worldly work, is cognitively and
        physically demanding. Rest is necessary and permissible. However, the
        quality and nature of rest determines whether it leads to benefit or
        harm. There is a saying that whoever rests from demanding work and their
        rest is not upon a sunnah, then they rest upon disobedience (maksiah).
        While the exact chain of this narration requires verification, its
        wisdom is sound: rest should be purposeful and aligned with beneficial
        activities.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 2 – Categories of Permissible Rest</h4>
      <p>
        Permissible forms of rest for government members fall into two
        categories:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Ibadah-Based Rest:</strong> Worship activities that relax the
          mind and body, including: reciting Quran (while sitting facing the
          qiblah, not lying down), dhikr and supplication, voluntary prayers,
          and seeking Islamic knowledge (or truth-seeking in general).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Social Rest:</strong> Networking and bonding with people,
          including: conversations with family, friends, or colleagues,
          community gatherings and social activities, and building and
          maintaining relationships.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Both forms serve legitimate purposes. Ibadah provides spiritual renewal
        and reward. Social interaction strengthens bonds that may serve
        beneficial purposes later, biidhnillah, and is not inherently
        procrastination but rather progress in building valuable relationships.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 3 – The Quran as Cooldown</h4>
      <p>
        When experiencing cognitive tension or brain fog after demanding work,
        the primary recommended sunnah activity is reciting Quran while sitting
        and facing the qiblah. Shaytan often whispers that you are unable to
        release tension through Quran recitation, leading you toward haram
        activities such as lying down and scrolling. Resist this whisper. If
        brain fog persists after Quran recitation, seek Allah's help through
        more supplication, or shift to other beneficial activities: either
        social interaction (non-solitary) or physical sunnah activities even if
        it is solitary (because inshaallah it is an ibadah too). Struggle
        against the temptation to default to mindless consumption. Bismillah.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h3>TITLE 2 : FORBIDDEN GHAFLAH</h3>

      <h4>Article 4 – Scrolling Without Keyword (SWK)</h4>
      <p>
        Scrolling without a keyword means you do not have a particular direction
        or objective to achieve. It usually aims to "relax" your brain after a
        hard task to relieve mental tension, but this is actually harmful. As a
        government, you need to network with people as a form of entertainment,
        not engage in solitary entertainment or activity (ibadah is allowed
        though). Note that SWK is different from scrolling with a keyword. When
        you have a keyword to search, it means you are in a research session to
        gather data that will later be analyzed and interpreted into a useful
        output (such as policies, papers, and so on). By engaging in SWK, it
        indicates that you are unaware that you still have many objectives or
        projects that have not been completed. Even networking purely for
        entertainment is more useful. Bonding with humans is not inherently
        procrastination; rather, it is progress in building relationships that
        may serve another purpose later biidhnillah.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 5 – Video Watching</h4>
      <p>
        As a government, it is unethical to watch edited videos, especially
        without a keyword. You must preserve your brain energy as much as
        possible. Edited videos—particularly those with frequent cuts, music,
        visual effects, and sound effects—are cognitively draining. That is why
        you have assistants: to translate any important content, regardless of
        format, into written form that is relevant for a government leader to
        notice. Not every piece of content deserves your attention as a
        government leader.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 6 – News SWK</h4>
      <p>
        Most news algorithms function as echo chambers with which you have no
        real connection, especially if you are a layperson without a direct role
        in global affairs. What is the use of reading news from another
        continent if you have no influence there or if you are not researching
        something? News should primarily come from your own observation or be
        received through your intelligence network. Its purpose is to inform you
        of matters on which you can take direct action.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 7 – Solitary Digital Entertainment</h4>
      <p>
        All forms of solitary digital entertainment are forbidden as rest
        activities. This includes but is not limited to: social media browsing
        without purpose, watching entertainment videos, playing games alone, and
        consuming digital content in isolation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The distinction is clear: solitary <em>ibadah</em> (worship) is
        encouraged; solitary <em>entertainment</em> is forbidden. If you seek
        entertainment or relaxation beyond ibadah, engage in social activities
        that build relationships and bonds with people.
      </p>

      <h3>TITLE 3 : IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE</h3>

      <h4>Article 8 – Decision Framework for Rest</h4>
      <p>
        When experiencing the need for rest after demanding work, follow this
        decision framework:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 1:</strong> Attempt ibadah-based rest (preferably Quran
          recitation while sitting facing qiblah).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 2:</strong> If tension persists, increase supplication
          and ask Allah for relief.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 3:</strong> If still unable to focus on ibadah, shift to
          social rest (networking, conversation, community activity).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 4:</strong> Consider physical sunnah activities (walking,
          light exercise in permissible ways, as it falls under solitary ibadah
          inshaallah).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Never default to:</strong> Lying down and scrolling, watching
          videos without purpose, or any form of solitary digital entertainment.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Article 9 – Exceptions and Clarifications</h4>
      <p>
        Purpose-driven digital activity is not forbidden, even if conducted
        alone. This includes: research with specific keywords, work-related
        content review, educational materials with clear objectives, and
        communication necessary for duties.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key distinction is intentionality and purpose. If an activity has a
        clear objective that advances your responsibilities, knowledge, social
        bond or ibadah, it is permissible. If it is merely to "pass time" or
        "relax mindlessly," it falls under forbidden ghaflah.
