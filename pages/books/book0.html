        Dhikr is the act of re-remembering the truth. Could be done in your
        heart (affirming truth with your heart), and mouth (either for your own
        re-affirmation / re-alignation, or for the purpose of truth conveyance
        to others).

      <h3>TITLE 3 : VARIOUS PRINCIPLES OF DHIKR</h3>

      <h4>Article 1 – Dhikr Is Not the Creation of Truth</h4>

      <p>
        Dhikr is the affirmation of truth, not the creation of truth. To think
        of dhikr as creating truth would be like praising God as if He were not
        already praiseworthy. Dhikr is not meant to sugarcoat reality. Dhikr is
        not for flattery or "ass-kissing," like praising a boss just to satisfy
        their ego or cover their insecurity. Dhikr is simply the affirmation of
        what is true. God is Z even if you never say that God is Z. Z does not
        wait for your affirmation in order to be Z. Z is self-sufficient, with
        or without your affirmation.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 2 – False or Partial Truth Produces False Response</h4>

      When what is believed to be true is in fact false, incomplete, or
      selectively chosen, the response that follows will necessarily be
      misaligned with reality. A person does not react to reality as it is, but
      to the version of truth they have accepted. If that accepted “truth” is
      partial, emotionally convenient, or born of desire rather than reality,
      then judgment, emotion, and action will be directed toward something that
      does not fully exist. Thus, correct dhikr requires not merely remembrance,
      but remembrance grounded in complete and accurate truth. Where truth is
      truncated, reaction is misdirected.
      <h4>Article 3 – Dhikr Aligns You to Truth, Not Vice Versa</h4>

      <p>
        You are no longer saying, <em>“God, please be this,”</em> but rather,
        <em>“I acknowledge that God is this.”</em> This is a fundamental shift:
        you do not define or dictate what God SHOULD be for you; instead, you
        define how you SHOULD be toward God. When you stop trying to bend
        reality to your preferences and instead align yourself with reality as
        it is, your reaction to reality becomes clearer, free from emotional
        distortion. You are no longer attempting to control reality; you are
        controlling yourself and your mode of encountering reality so that you
        can adapt to it (bi idhnillah). This alignment allows you to respond
        appropriately to what is actually there.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 3 – Dhikr is Not a Transaction</h4>

      <p>
        Dhikr is not a transaction of the form "I praise, You reward." There is
        nothing to negotiate because dhikr is not a bargaining tool. That's why
        when you want or need something from God, you ask Him through direct
        prayer, not through dhikr with hidden motives. Dhikr has a different
        function: it aligns you with reality as it is, allowing you to perceive
        it without emotional distortion and to respond to it well in order to
        achieve what you need. Prayer is asking; dhikr is internal realignment.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 4 – Dhikr as a Resting Place</h4>

      <p>
        If truth does not depend on you, then you are freed from an impossible
        burden. You do not have to hold the universe together. You do not have
        to feel that you have earned your existence through your own power. Of
        course, you must seek God's approval—that is essential—but you do not
        secure it by feeling that your performance has contributed something
        that makes God more worthy or more complete. God's worthiness does not
        depend on your contributions. That realization is deeply calming and
        humbling. Dhikr becomes a resting place and a counseling place—where you
        are constantly reminded of truth and humbled by it (coz either sometimes
        we are wrong or unable to apply truth fully via our strength but rather
        God's strength, or the truth content itself is humbling us ), constantly
        reshaped internally to be molded by it—rather than a stage where you are
        inflated by the feeling that your performance contributes to God’s
        worthiness.
      </p>

      <h4>Article 5 – "I Am as My Servant Thinks of Me"</h4>

      <p>
        Allah says: "I am as My servant thinks of Me." {Hadith Qudsi, Sahih
        al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim}. This does not mean you create God by
        believing in Him, or that truth bends to your psychology. Rather, it
        means this: your experience of God corresponds to your assumption about
        God. God is what He is—but you encounter Him through the lens you carry.
        If you assume God is angry, you do not make God angry; you place
        yourself in a posture where anger is what you encounter. If you assume
        God is merciful, you do not bend God toward mercy; you become receptive
        to the mercy already present. However, your behavior must also align
        with this understanding. You cannot continuously claim that God is
        merciful while persistently doing things that provoke His anger. Yes,
        God is Merciful, but God is also Just. You cannot deliberately conceal
        one truth while invoking another through dhikr. You cannot adopt a
        partial truth. The lens you carry must be informed by full truth, not
        partial truth born of wishful thinking. That is why the real question is
        this: does dhikr (the re-remembering of truth) actually change you, or
        are you using it as a form of self-deception?
      </p>
      <h4>Article 6 – Dhikr is an Act of Ibadah</h4>

      <p>
        Even though dhikr is only meant to align you with the truth (it does not
        benefit God in any way), it is still an act of ibadah that God rewards.
        This is part of God’s mercy. So be grateful, and be khusyu, and make
        dhikr an act of worship, rather than a way of making yourself feel like
        the most aligned-to-the-truth person of all.
      </p>
      <h4>Article 7 – The Prayer for a Good End</h4>

      <p>
        Blessed is the one who dies in a good state, approaching God from the
        angle of mercy at the time of death. This is not guaranteed by the state
        of your heart at that final moment alone—you cannot control your own
        feelings—but by the true mercy of God, which moves you to remember Him
        at the time of death. Therefore, continually ask God for guidance: that
        He grants you constant dhikr and the grace to meet Him well,
        acknowledging His mercy even as you acknowledge your need for it.
      </p>
      <h4>Article 8 – Truth Is Always at Stake</h4>

      <p>
        Every dhikr we say is tied to a real awareness of what is at stake—what
        depends on Allah, what could be lost without Him, what mistakes or
        misunderstandings the phrase corrects, or what ultimate truth it points
        to. Dhikr should not be done mechanically, but with knowledge of why you
        are doing that specific dhikr. You must know what is at stake when you
        are saying it. Without this awareness, dhikr becomes shallow—why do
        something if there is no stake? Are you just performing empty motions?
        <strong>The structure is:</strong> Dhikr Phrase → Recognition of What is
        at Stake → Conscious Saying. <strong>Example Applications:</strong>

      <h3>TITLE 4 : OUTPUT OF DHIKR</h3>
      <p>
        Dhikr usually has a transformative effect—not magically, but by aligning
        all your emotions and thoughts with the truth. This alignment is,
        biidhnillah, what strengthens you in difficult situations. But remember,
        dhikr is not the only option. When the stakes are very high, deadly,
        beyond your control, you can turn to direct prayer. Transformation
        begins within the self, and as a result, outward change often follows
        naturally or can be intentionally encouraged. Therefore, whenever we
        perform acts of dhikr—such as reading, recitation, remembrance, and so
        on—we should:
