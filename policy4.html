      <h3>TITLE 1 : CONCEPT AND POLICY</h3>

      <!-- Article: paragraph + emphasis -->
      <h4>Article 1 – Cooldown Concept</h4>
      <p>
        Each significant job (especially worldly job) is cognitively and
        physically tensing. Human need cooldown phase to release the tense, and
        sometimes the cooldown phase is the opportunity for shaytan to astray us
        into useless or even sinful activity. Thats why i heard (i don't know if
        this is from prophet or not) that whoever is resting (from demanding
        work) and the rest is not on a sunnah, then he rest on a maksiah.
        Wallahualam you need to research this. So it means that sunnah activity
        could be a resting / relaxing activity.
      </p>

      <!-- Article: paragraph -->
      <h4>Article 2 – Quran Cooldown Policy</h4>
      <p>
        Rest on a sunnah activity. The first sunnah we will try for this
        cooldown phase is reciting quran. Whoever want to relax their tense /
        brain fog, recite quran (but duduk ngadep kiblat) and not rebahan plus
        scrolling, coz rebahan and scrolling is the silent killer of your life.
        The best satan tool in 21st century to astray you from useful and
        rewarding activity. Please note that satan always make you assume that
        you are unable to release the cognitive tense / brain fog by reading
        quran then you do haram activity (for you) such as rebahan and
        scrolling. The death combo in the 21st century. But inshallah it can (remember that quran is a cure by Allah will), and you must struggle for it too, dont easy to quit to
        rebahan and scrolling if the brainfog is still not gone, ask Allah more,
        quit to other non-solitary activity or physical sunnah. Bismillah.
